Some Notes
---

* The name of the language: it's spelled "café";  one may also use "cafe" if in
  a non-unicode context.   The name should be capitalized as if it were an
  improper noun  (that means, in titles and at the beginnings of sentences).
  The name of the compiler is `cafec`. Spelling it `caféc` is also fine.
* any SCREAMING_SNAKES identifiers are intended as a stop-gap,  to be replaced
  later, and only exist because the compiler isn't  really very good yet.
  Examples include the operator functions, which will be replaced by the
  appropriate operators eventually.

Code of Conduct
---

* I feel that it's necessary to have a code of conduct. It can be found in
  [code-of-conduct.md][coc].
* In order to contribute to this project, or to be a part of the café community,
  you must follow this code of conduct whenever you're in a public forum
  dedicated to café (i.e., this github).
* We understand that sometimes people are frustrated, or having a bad day, and
  sometimes we screw up. This lays out our ideal, but it's okay to screw up in
  good faith! We all fall down, we just have to get back up again.
* Most of all, be friendly to people.
