Some Notes
---

* The name of the language: it's spelled "café";
  one may also use "cafe" if in a non-unicode context.
  The name should be capitalized as if it were an improper noun
  (that means, in titles and at the beginnings of sentences).
  The name of the compiler is `cafec`. Spelling it `caféc` is also fine.
* any SCREAMING_SNAKES identifiers are intended as a stop-gap,
  to be replaced later, and only exist because the compiler isn't
  really very good yet. Examples include the operator functions,
  which will be replaced by the appropriate operators eventually.
